# Lab 1 - Getting Started with the ExositeReady SDK

The ExositeReady SDK is a software framework provided by Exosite to ease development of production-quality embedded device firmware for IoT products. It's open source software, provided under the Apache-2.0 license, that means that you're free to do whatever you'd like with it as long as you share any changes to the SDK itself while being able to keep the rest of your application's code private if that's what you'd like.

In this lab you'll go through getting the PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity Starter Kit flashed with the demo firmware provided alongside the ER SKD. You'll learn the basics of what is required to get IoT devices connected to the Exosite platform and see real-time data from your devices streaming to your web browser.

## Requirements

* PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity Starter Kit
* An Internet Connection
* A Computer with MPLAB IDE, including:
  * MPLABX IDE v 3.30
  * Harmony v1.08
  * XC32 v1.40b
* The ExositeReady SDK, plus
  * The PIC32MZECSK port & example application

If you don't have any of the above software installed, see the [Lab Setup Guide](../setup) before proceeding with this Lab. MASTERS attendees that have access to the in-class lab computers should have everything setup already.

# Let's Go

First you'll want to open MPLAB X.

And open the `er_vfp_microchip_harmony` project, which can be found in the "C:\microchip\harmony\v1_08\apps\er_vfp_microchip_harmony\firmware" folder.

You can now explore the source of this project if you'd like.

## Running the Example

Before we dig into what the code is doing, let's build, flash, and run the provided example.

Connect the Starter Kit board to you computer using both mini USB connectors; one is for the onboard debugger and the other is for access to the serial terminal.

If you have more than one project open in MPLAB, make sure that the `er_vfp_microchip_harmony` project is set as the main project, it's name should appear in the window's title bar, you can do this simply clicking on the project in the 'Projects' tab in the left-side bar.

Now, click the "Make and Program Device Main Project" button to build the firmware image and flash it to the board.

You may be prompted to select a different device, this will happen if the starter kit you're using isn't the last one used with this project. MPLAB should offer to switch to the kit that is currently connected to your computer; just click "OK". If you're shown a list of tools, there should only be one valid option. Choose the item listed under "Starter Kits (PKOB)".

![Tool List](../images/tool_list.png)

It will take several minutes to compile and flash the board.

> Note: Reflashing the board erases the CIK, a token generated by the server for the device to be able to identify itself. Since you don't have access to the actual admin console on the Exosite platform, I've created a tool for us to work around this security feature. Every time you re-flash the board you'll need to submit the form on https://exoshim.webscript.io/enable with your board's MAC address (serial number) and the current model ("ta7lsaumvswz5mi" in labs 1 and 2, "4yfpd06gr1thuxr" in lab 3). If you don't have the MAC address, wait until the flashing is complete and open the debug serial terminal, explained further down.

Once this is complete, the board will boot the demo application, connect to Exosite's servers, and begin reading & writing data. Once this happens you should see the three LEDs, red, yellow, and green, along the 40-pin header turn on.

To follow the progress of the application booting and connecting, or to troubleshoot any issues, you can use a serial terminal application to view the application's debug log. Open the serial terminal application on the computer and connect to the virtual serial port provided by the device, it should be the only one available on your computer. If you don't see any make sure you have a miniUSB cable connecting the port under the Ethernet port.

<!-- NTS: Expand the above section after figuring out what application they will have on these machines. -->

## Interacting with the Board Via the Web

Once the board has booted the application and connected you can control the LEDs and see the status of the buttons through a custom web app that was created specifically for this class.

To find your board, go to [https://er-simple-demo.apps.exosite.io](https://er-simple-demo.apps.exosite.io) and find your board in the list by looking at the MAC address. (Note: You can find you device's MAC address by watching the serial terminal output when you first boot the application.) Select your device and toggle some of the LEDs on and off or press SW1 or SW2 (next to the red and orange LEDs) on the board to see the "count" in the webui change.

## End of Lab 1

Congratulations, you've now created your very own IoT device. Now that we know all of the tools are working, in the next lab we will actually dive into the code, explain the major points, and make some basic modifications to test your new found knowledge.

> Note: I would suggest leaving MPLAB and this project open, lab 2 will pickup right where this one is leaving off.
